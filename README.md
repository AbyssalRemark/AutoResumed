<h1>AutoResumed</h1>

In the modern era resumes are suppose to be customtalored to the job you are applying to. But, In todays market the way to apply to jobs is to apply on mass. These two things are seemingly contradictory and a tedious and ever growing time sync.

## Challenges we ran into
Fleshing out this database was a nightmare, creddit to Quinn on that one. His work in ironing out this extensive and verbose system was intense. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Many pivots and shifts have lead this project to quite the undertaking. At current the CLI has been mostly stripped down in favor of a web interface. Many late nights and many constant hours have lead this to be the project it is today.
